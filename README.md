# Cursor Open File/Folder Alfred Workflow

This Alfred workflow allows you to open files or folders using the Cursor application.

## First-Time Setup

To ensure the workflow functions correctly, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure the Cursor application is properly installed.
2. Open "System Preferences" > "Security & Privacy" > "Privacy".
3. Select "Automation" from the list on the left.
4. Ensure that Alfred has permission to access Finder. If not, add Alfred and check the box next to Finder.
5. If necessary, restart Alfred to apply the changes.

## Usage

- In Alfred, type the keyword (e.g., "oc"), followed by the path to the file or folder you want to open.
- If you don't enter a path, the workflow will attempt to open the currently selected Finder item or the current Finder window.

If any issues occur, the workflow will display a dialog box explaining the error and providing suggestions for resolution.
